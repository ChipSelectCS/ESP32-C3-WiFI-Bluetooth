# ESP32-C3-WiFI-Bluetooth

This is a simple ESP32 board that has been tested for quality WIFI and Bluetooth functionality. It is very small and slick to fit into any places.
To program it succesfully I recommend to use a very short cable around 10 cm, since the usb connection has not been routed well.
Also the flash memory needs some rework as for now it causes problems with boot.

To open files simply drag them into EasyEda environment and save to a single folder.
